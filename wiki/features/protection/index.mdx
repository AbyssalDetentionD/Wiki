# Land Protection System

In AbyssalDetention, protecting your hard-earned builds and resources is crucial for survival and success. Our comprehensive land protection system ensures your cell, shops, and investments remain safe from grief, theft, and unauthorized access.

## How Land Protection Works

### Claim System Overview

**Claims** are protected areas where only you and trusted players can build, break blocks, or access containers. Think of them as your personal territory within the prison grounds.

**Key Features:**

- **Player Permissions:** Grant access to specific players for collaboration
- **Automatic Protection:** No need to protect individual chests or blocks
- **Grief Prevention:** Unauthorized players cannot modify your claim
- **PvP Control:** Decide whether PvP is allowed in your claim areas

**Protection Includes:**

- Block placement and breaking
- Container access (chests, furnaces, etc.)
- Door and trapdoor usage
- Button and lever interaction
- Animal and villager protection
- Item frame and armor stand security

<Note title="Claim Limits">
  New players start with 1,000 claim blocks. Earn more through playtime, voting, and rank
  progression!
