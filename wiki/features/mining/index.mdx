# Mining System

Mining is the cornerstone of life in AbyssalDetention. Whether you're a new inmate learning to survive or a veteran prisoner running massive operations, the mining system offers depth, progression, and endless opportunities for advancement.

## Mining Basics

### Getting Started

**Essential Equipment:**

- **Pickaxe:** Your primary tool (start with wooden, upgrade quickly)
- **Torches:** Light sources for safe mining
- **Food:** Sustenance for long mining sessions
- **Bucket:** Water for lava safety and item retrieval

**First Steps:**

1. **Visit the Mine Entrance** at spawn - clearly marked with signs
2. **Choose Your Starting Area** - beginner zones are safer and well-lit
3. **Follow Safety Protocols** - stay in designated areas initially
4. **Start Simple** - focus on coal and iron for basic needs

### Mining Areas & Access

**Public Mining Zones:**

- **Surface Quarry (Y: 40-64):** Open to all players, basic ores
- **Upper Tunnels (Y: 20-40):** Guard rank required, moderate ores
- **Deep Shafts (Y: 0-20):** Warden rank required, rare materials
- **Restricted Depths (Y: -64-0):** Prestige only, legendary ores

**Private Claims:**

- Purchase personal mining claims for exclusive access
- Sizes range from 16x16 to 64x64 blocks
- Claim protection prevents grief and theft
- Upgrade claims with better tools and larger areas

<Note title="Safety First">
  Always carry emergency supplies! Lava, cave-ins, and getting lost are real dangers in the deeper
  mining areas.
</Note>

## Mining Mechanics

### Tool Efficiency

**Pickaxe Tiers & Speed:**

- **Wooden:** 1x speed, basic ores only
- **Stone:** 1.5x speed, improved durability
- **Iron:** 2x speed, access to most ores
- **Diamond:** 3x speed, all vanilla ores
- **Netherite:** 4x speed, some custom ores
- **Custom Tools:** 5-10x speed, all materials
