# Resource Pack Guide

AbyssalDetention's custom resource pack is **essential** for the full server experience. It transforms the visual landscape with hundreds of custom textures, animations, and effects that bring our prison world to life. This guide covers everything you need to know about getting and using the resource pack.

## Why the Resource Pack is Essential

### What You'll Miss Without It

**Custom Ores:**

- Over 20 unique ore types appear as generic blocks
- No visual distinction between rare and common materials
- Missing animated effects and particle systems
- Cannot identify valuable custom ores while mining

**Enhanced Items:**

- Custom tools and equipment look like vanilla items
- Special armor sets lose their unique appearance
- Collectible items appear as generic materials
- No visual progression indicators for upgrades

**Prison Atmosphere:**

- Default textures break immersion of prison environment
- Missing themed decorations and environmental details
- No custom UI elements for prison-specific systems
- Generic appearance instead of curated aesthetic experience

**Gameplay Impact:**

- Cannot effectively identify valuable materials
- Miss visual cues for rare discoveries
- Reduced ability to appreciate builds and environments
- Limited understanding of item values and rarity

<Note title="Absolutely Required">
  While you CAN play without the resource pack, you'll miss 70%+ of the custom content and visual
  experience that makes AbyssalDetention unique!
