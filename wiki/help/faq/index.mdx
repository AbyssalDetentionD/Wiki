# Frequently Asked Questions

Welcome to our comprehensive FAQ! These are the most commonly asked questions from new and experienced players alike. If you can't find your answer here, check our other wiki sections or contact staff for assistance.

## Getting Started Questions

### Q: How do I join the server?

**A:** Connect to `play.abyssaldetention.com` using Minecraft Java Edition. The server supports versions 1.20.4 and newer. When you first join, you'll be prompted to download our custom resource pack - make sure to accept it for the full experience!

### Q: Do I need to download anything special?

**A:** The only requirement is our custom resource pack, which should download automatically when you join. If it doesn't auto-download due to client permission settings, you can get it manually from our Discord server. No other mods or downloads are required.

### Q: What version of Minecraft do I need?

**A:** We support Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.4 and newer versions. Bedrock Edition is not supported. We recommend using the latest stable version for the best experience.

### Q: Is this server free to play?

**A:** Absolutely! AbyssalDetention is completely free to play with no pay-to-win mechanics. All content is accessible through gameplay. Optional donations support server development but provide only cosmetic benefits.

### Q: I'm completely new to prison servers. Where do I start?

**A:** Start with our [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started/first-steps) and visit the Tutorial Center at spawn. Join our Discord community, read the server rules, and don't hesitate to ask questions in chat - our community loves helping newcomers!

<Note title="New Player Support">
  Don't be overwhelmed! Focus on mining, basic survival, and creating your first land claim.
  Everything else can be learned gradually as you play.
</Note>

## Gameplay Questions

### Q: How do I make money on the server?

**A:** The primary money-making method is mining ores and selling them. Use `/sellall` to sell everything in your inventory or `/sell hand` for specific items. You can also:

- Start a player shop business
- Complete daily voting rewards
- Choose a job specialty for bonus income
- Trade with other players
- Participate in server events

### Q: What are custom ores and why do I need the resource pack?

**A:** Custom ores are unique materials beyond vanilla Minecraft ores, like Crimson Ore, Abyssal Stone, and Prismatic Shards. The resource pack is essential because without it, these valuable ores appear as generic stone blocks, and you'll miss out on discovering rare, profitable materials.

### Q: How do land claims work?

**A:** Land claims protect your builds from grief and theft. Use `/claim tool` to get a golden shovel, then right-click two opposite corners to create a protected area. You start with 1,000 claim blocks and earn 100 more per hour played. Use `/trust <player>` to allow friends access to your claim.

### Q: How do I rank up?

**A:** Ranking requires balanced progress across multiple areas:

- **Mining:** Collect ores and develop mining skills
- **Economy:** Earn money through various methods
- **Playtime:** Consistent server activity
- **Community:** Help others and maintain positive behavior

Check `/rank` to see your current progress and requirements for the next rank.

### Q: What are minions and how do I get them?

**A:** Minions are automated workers that gather resources while you're offline. You can purchase them from the Minion Shop at spawn once you reach appropriate ranks. They require fuel and maintenance but provide passive income. Start with basic mining minions and upgrade as you progress.

## Technical Questions

### Q: The resource pack didn't download automatically. What do I do?

**A:** This usually happens due to Minecraft client permissions. Try these solutions:

1. Check your firewall and antivirus settings
2. Join our Discord and download the pack manually from #resource-pack
3. Ensure Minecraft has permission to download files
4. Try connecting from a different network
5. Contact staff if problems persist

### Q: I'm experiencing lag or poor performance. How can I improve it?

**A:** Try these optimization steps:

- Lower your render distance to 8-12 chunks
- Reduce graphics settings (particles, animations)
- Allocate more RAM to Minecraft (6-8GB recommended)
- Close other programs while playing
- Use Optifine for performance improvements
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection

### Q: Can I use mods on the server?

**A:** These mods are allowed:

- **Optifine** - Performance and visual improvements
- **Minimap mods** - Navigation aids (no player/mob radar)
- **Inventory management** - Sorting and organization tools
- **JEI/REI** - Recipe and item information

Prohibited mods include x-ray, fly hacks, auto-clickers, and any modifications that provide unfair advantages.

### Q: I lost my items due to a bug/glitch. Can staff help?

**A:** Staff may assist with item recovery in cases of confirmed server bugs or glitches. Provide screenshots, detailed explanation of what happened, and use `/helpop` or create a support ticket. However, items lost due to player error (falls, lava, etc.) typically cannot be recovered.

## Economy and Trading Questions

### Q: How do player shops work?

**A:** Player shops use chest-based signs with this format:

```
[SHOP]
<quantity>
B <buy_price> : S <sell_price>
<item_name>
```

You need a shop license (costs vary by rank) and a plot in a commercial area. Stock the chest behind the sign with items, and players can buy/sell automatically.

### Q: What's the auction house and how do I use it?

**A:** The auction house (`/ah`) is a server-wide bidding system. You can list items for auction with starting bids and duration settings. Other players bid on items, and the highest bidder wins. It's great for selling rare items or finding unique materials.

### Q: Are there any items I can't trade or sell?

**A:** Generally, all legitimate items can be traded. However:

- Items obtained through exploits may be removed
- Some quest or achievement items might be account-bound
- Staff-given items for specific purposes may have restrictions
- Real money trading (RMT) is strictly prohibited and results in permanent bans

### Q: How does the banking system work?

**A:** Banks provide secure storage for money beyond your personal balance limit, offer interest on savings (2% monthly), and provide loans for major purchases. Visit the bank at spawn or use `/bank` commands to manage your account.

## Rules and Policies Questions

### Q: What happens if I break a rule?

**A:** AbyssalDetention uses a progressive punishment system:

- **First offense:** Warning and education
- **Second offense:** Formal written warning
- **Third offense:** Temporary punishment (mute, kick, short ban)
- **Continued violations:** Escalating punishments up to permanent ban

Severity affects punishment level - serious violations may skip steps.

### Q: Can I appeal a ban or punishment?

**A:** Yes! You can appeal through our forum at [forum.abyssaldetention.com](https://forum.abyssaldetention.com/) or Discord ticket system. Wait at least 24 hours before appealing, include all required information, take responsibility for your actions, and show understanding of why the rule exists.

### Q: Is griefing allowed anywhere on the server?

**A:** No, griefing is prohibited everywhere. This includes:

- Destroying others' builds
- Stealing from unlocked containers
- Placing inappropriate blocks
- Sabotaging community projects
  Always use land claims to protect your builds and respect others' property.

### Q: Can I have multiple accounts?

**A:** No, only one account per person is allowed. Family members may play on the same IP with staff approval. Account sharing, trading, or selling is prohibited. You are responsible for all actions on your account.

<Note title="Rule Clarification">
  When in doubt about whether something is allowed, ask staff before doing it. It's better to ask
  than risk punishment for unclear situations.
</Note>

## Community Questions

### Q: How do I join the Discord community?

**A:** Use `/discord` in-game to get the invite link, or visit [discord.abyssaldetention.com](https://discord.abyssaldetention.com).
