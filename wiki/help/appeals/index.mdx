# Ban Appeals Guide

If you've been banned from AbyssalDetention, you have the right to appeal your punishment through our formal appeals process. This guide explains how appeals work, what information to include, and how to maximize your chances of a successful appeal.

## Understanding the Appeals Process

### When You Can Appeal

**Appealable Punishments:**

- **Permanent Bans** - Any ban without a specified end date
- **Temporary Bans Over 7 Days** - Extended punishments affecting significant playtime
- **IP Bans** - Network-level restrictions that affect multiple users
- **False Positive Punishments** - Automated systems occasionally make errors

**Non-Appealable Punishments:**

- **Mutes Under 24 Hours** - Short communication restrictions
- **Kicks** - Temporary removal from server with immediate rejoin ability
- **Temporary Bans Under 7 Days** - Short-term punishments
- **Repeated Offenses** - Multiple violations of the same rule type

**Special Circumstances:**

- **Staff Discretion** may allow appeals for normally non-appealable punishments
- **New Evidence** can reopen closed appeals in exceptional cases
- **Technical Issues** affecting innocent players are always reviewed
- **Account Security** compromises may warrant special consideration

<Note title="Wait Period Required">
  You must wait at least 24 hours after receiving a punishment before submitting an appeal. This
  cooling-off period allows for reflection and better appeal quality.

### Example Appeal Template

```
**Username:** PlayerName123
**Ban Reason:** Griefing other players' builds
**Date of Ban:** January 15, 2025
**Banning Staff:** ModeratorName
**Appeal Type:** First Appeal

**What Happened:**
On January 15th, I was mining near another player's base and became frustrated when I couldn't find good ores. In my anger, I broke some blocks on their building and placed inappropriate blocks. I was banned shortly after for griefing. I understand this was completely wrong and unacceptable behavior.

**Rule Understanding:**
I violated the griefing rule which prohibits destroying or modifying other players' builds without permission. This rule exists to protect players' hard work and maintain a safe, fun environment for everyone. My actions damaged someone else's creation and violated their trust in the community.

**Responsibility and Remorse:**
I take full responsibility for my actions. There is no excuse for destroying someone else's work, regardless of my frustration or emotional state. I am genuinely sorry for the harm I caused to that player and the negative impact on the community. I understand that my behavior was immature and harmful.

**Improvement Plan:**
If unbanned, I commit to:
- Using land claims to protect my own builds and respecting others' claims
- Taking breaks when frustrated instead of acting impulsively
- Asking for help from community members when struggling with gameplay
- Contributing positively by helping new players and following all rules
I have read the rules thoroughly and understand the consequences of future violations.
```

- **Multiple Appeals** - Spamming appeals through different channels
- **Involving Others** - Having friends submit appeals on your behalf
- **Public Pressure** - Trying to create community pressure for unban

## Special Circumstances

### Technical Appeals

- **Following Orders** - Told by others that behavior was allowed

**Important Notes:**

- Each appeal is evaluated individually

- Leadership and followers may receive different consideration
- Group appeals are not allowed - each player must appeal separately

<Note title="Security First">

  passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and document security improvements.
